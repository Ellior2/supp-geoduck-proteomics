R Scripts used in analysis.

`geoduck-gonad-nmds.R` = calculation of coefficients of variation, NMDS, and ANOSIM for gonad DDA.     
`geoduck-SRM-analysis.R` = normalization of SRM data by QCs, NMDS, ANOSIM, heat maps, and calc of CVs for gonad SRM data.     
`hemolymph.R` = normalization of SRM data by QCs, NMDS, ANOSIM, heat maps, and calc of CVs for hemolymph SRM data.
